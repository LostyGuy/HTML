# Website I made for collegues from work

## Quick introduction
### Since we switch workstations with each other I have came to an idea that will solve most of our communication problems

That is a place where most of our crucial information are held in case someone will need them to guide guest further.
Each workstation has it's own space where we specify what are the need of chosen place.
The structure is:

-Main Page
  -Hol
    -Seat Order
    -Tickets Regulations
  -Balkon I
    -Seat Order
  -Balkon II
    -Seat Order
  -Balkon III
    -Seat Order
    -Door Guide
    -TV Guide
    -Lights Guide
  -Excel - I've made a simplified DataBase with our shows so we can find how long and when will it end as well as every act in it
